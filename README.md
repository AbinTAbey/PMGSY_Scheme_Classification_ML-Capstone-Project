# PMGSY_Scheme_Classification_ML-Project
Intelligent Classification of PMGSY Rural Infrastructure Projects using Machine Learning
Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning solution that automatically classifies rural infrastructure projects—such as roads and bridges—under the appropriate phase or scheme of the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY). By leveraging government-provided datasets from the AI Kosh initiative and implementing the entire workflow on IBM Cloud Lite services, the solution intends to help government agencies, infrastructure planners, and policy analysts streamline the monitoring and management of thousands of projects. Efficient classification is crucial for transparent budgeting, efficient resource allocation, and data-driven assessment of the long-term impact of various PMGSY schemes.
Problem Statement
The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) is a flagship rural development program by the Government of India that provides all-weather road connectivity to unconnected rural habitations. Over several phases (including PMGSY-I, PMGSY-II, and RCPLWEA), each scheme brings unique objectives, funding mechanisms, and project specifications. Manually categorizing the vast number of completed and ongoing rural infrastructure projects is labor-intensive, potentially error-prone, and difficult to scale as the volume of data grows. The challenge is to design, build, and evaluate a machine learning model that classifies each road or bridge project into its correct PMGSY_SCHEME based on its physical and financial characteristics. The goal is to offer an accurate, scalable, and reproducible system that enables government stakeholders to quickly and reliably categorize projects, improving operational efficiency and transparency in rural infrastructure development.
